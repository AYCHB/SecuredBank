# Peer Appraisal
## Ng Wei Hong Darren

"Darren is an excellent and experienced programmer. Being the one with superior domain knowledge in our group, I have learnt alot working with him. The one thing I appreciate about him most is his high and demanding standard in which things are to be done. He does not settle for mediocrity and I believe individuals such as he can spearhead things to move, and projects to hit deadlines. "
